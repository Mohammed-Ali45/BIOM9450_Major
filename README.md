# BIOM9450 Major Project 2023

## Preliminary Intro
We must update this once we have committed to a project.
This project will involve coding in 4 different languages and utilising some database management software to create a web-based patient management system and potentially a platform of machine learning to make theoretical predictions on hypothetical patients and their likelihood to contract some form of illness or disease.
While the project is still young, the rest of this description will be a to-do-list. If it wasn't clear, I don't yet know what I'm doing.

1. Establish programming environment for all 4 languages and DBMS
2. Build website UI
3. Generate patient database
4. Implement machine learning predictor
